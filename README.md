# Neural-Networks-Machine-Learning-Examples

## Introduction

These are a set of codes examples from my course Neuro Control Motor in 2017. The idea is that people who are staring studying artificial Neural Networks or Machine Learning Algorithms could have a view of what you can achieve with this algorithms.

The codes were written in Matlab R2015a. I will try to create the Python version later. Some of the variables and comments could be also in Spanish. However, it's nothing that Google Translator cannot solve XD.
