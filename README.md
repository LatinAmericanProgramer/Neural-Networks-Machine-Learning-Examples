# Neural-Networks-Machine-Learning-Examples

## Introduction

These are a set of codes examples from my course Neuro Control Motor in 2017. The idea is that people who are staring studying artificial Neural Networks (ANN) or Machine Learning Algorithms could have a view of what you can achieve with this algorithms.

The codes were written in Matlab R2015a. I will try to create the Python version later. Some of the variables and comments could be also in Spanish. However, it's nothing that Google Translator cannot solve XD.

### SOM_v1.m - Self Organized Map

This example shows the Self Organized Map or SOM neural network in action. In summary, this type of ANN is trained using Unsupervise Learning to generate a representation of an input space, in this case a two dimensional equilateral tiangle (Fig. 1.).

Figure 1.

Before starting the training process of this SOM, their neurons (Fig. 2, blue points) occupy a random position compared with the input space (Fig. 2, red points)

Figure 2.

After giving the input space to the SOM 500 times, the neurons have learn to represent the topology of the input space as shown in (Fig. 3, blue points)
